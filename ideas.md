minesweeper but:
- your player is a snake that grows and his head uncovers the grid so you can't touch mines with him
- there's chess pieces on the ends of the board that can't go on mines (so chess but your board is a minesweeper board)
- you have a number of citizens that move randomly every turn and you can choose to make some sleep for that turn to prevent a mine explosion, you can mark only one mine per turn, you can only do maybe one special thing like cast a spell on the person that does something good but at the cost of another person having to advance twice, try to stay as long as possible to uncover all mines and survive as many ppl as you can! you lose if only one is left
